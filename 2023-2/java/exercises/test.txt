A stream is a sequence of data. In Java, a stream is composed of bytes.
It's called a stream because it is like a stream of water that continues to flow.
In Java, 3 streams are created for us automatically.
All these streams are attached with the console.

1) System.out: standard output stream

2) System.in: standard input stream

3) System.err: standard error stream
